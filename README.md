# Building a debug version from Android Studio #

[![Add new run configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/MozStumbler/dev/docs/screencaps/add_new_config.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/MozStumbler/dev/docs/screencaps/add_new_config.png)

Setup the Android Application to use two gradle aware make targets.
You must set Package to be installed to "Do not deploy anything".
Make sure you run assembleGithubDebug, then installGithubDebug.

# Signing #

In order to sign the APK, you will want to create a
'signing.properties' file under `android/properties`.  The content
should look like the following except it should contain your key
signing information:

```
StoreFile=<path to file>
StorePassword=<password>
KeyAlias=<key alias>
KeyPassword=<password>
```

To submit data using your own Mozilla API key to the Mozilla Location
Service, you will need a private-<productFlavor>.properties file in
`android/properties`. An example properties file is available in
`android/properties/example.properties`.

The gradle build will pick up private-<productFlavor>.properties
automatically.

So with :

```
./gradlew assembleGithubDebug
```

The build system will pick up
`android/properties/private-github.properties` as well as
`android/properties/signing.properties`.  If either of these property
files do not exist, then empty strings will be used.

For the OSM (OpenStreetMap) Tile Server, you have several options:

* *[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)* (easy, secure) is a hosted OSM
  solution, allowing users to easily create beautiful maps and
  featuring full SSL. To use MapBox:

  1. Visit [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/) and sign up
  2. From the [MapBox Dashboad](https://www.mapbox.com/dashboard/)
     click the big blue "Create Project" button
  3. Customize your map as you please. The only requirement is that
     you allow public API access. To do this click on the gear in the
     white box at the top, select the "Advanced" option at the bottom, and
     uncheck the "Hide project from public API" box. Be sure to hit the
     save button after doing this.
  4. Obtain the API key for your map (visible from the dashboard under
     Projects and Data, or in the URL of the editor)
  5. Set `TileServerURL` in the `gradle.propeties` file to
     `http://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/<API key>/`. Do not miss the
     tailing slash, it will break things if you do.i

*Note that, for historical reasons, you can simply specify the API
key in the `gradle.properties` file and not the full URL, using the
`MapAPIKey` key*

* *Another hosted solution* (difficulty varies, as does security).
  There are many OSM tile servers available. [This is a nice list of
  some](http://switch2osm.org/providers/).

* Run your own Tile Server (advanced, as secure as you want)
  You can, of course, run your own tileserver.
  [Switch2OSM](http://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/) has several
  excellent guides on the subject and is a good place to get started.

To generate a signing key, search the internet for details.  This
command is probably what you want:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias mozstumbler -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

To verify the apk has been signed, you can run this command:

```
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs android/build/outputs/apk/android-release.apk
```

Note that if signing failed, the gradle build system should not generate an android-release.apk file.
You will probably find only the `android-release-unsigned.apk` file.

# Releasing #

1. Bump the version numbers at the top of android/build.gradle
2. Make sure you have your signing keys,
   private-<productFlavor>.properties and signing.properties file configured.
3. You should have your keystore file in the `android/properties`
   directory.
4. Ensure all code is commited.  Tag the release with v<majorVersion>.<Minor>.<Patch> versions.
   You *must* prefix the version with a 'v'.
5. Push tags to wherever you need to.
6. There are now Github and Google Play Store releases.  Execute
   them with `make github` or `make playstore`.
7. You should end up with a signed apk MozStumbler-v<whatever_the_version_is>.apk in the `outputs` directory.
8. Browse to https://github.com/mozilla/MozStumbler/releases.
9. Update the release tag with the apk file.
10. Add some release notes and give @credit to contributors!
